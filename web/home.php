        <p>Over the two or so years, I've been really interested in learning about Computational Linguistics.  The idea
            that you can learn more about the features of a language by using statistics is so cool to me.  I love
            novel applications of computers, and I think that the changes that computational linguistics will make in
            computing in the next 20 years will be tremendous.</p>
        <p>Already computational linguistics is changing society around us, and very very few people understand even
            the most fundamental aspects of the field.  Voice assistants have changed the way that we think about our
            computers.  Whereas their functionality was once simply accessible, it is now omnipresent to those who use
            Siri, Google Assistant, Cortana, or Alexa.</p>
        <p>Imagine today's children, who are growing up in a world where speaking to computers is natural.  Nowhere in
            usage is any evidence that the mind behind the voice is a statistical model.  Like all technologies, the
            degree of trust that we give to voice assistants must be well considered, because the most intimate details
            of our lives are exposed when we open our home to AI models that listen to what we say. I hope to be
            actively engaged in making valuable contributions to society via highly trustworthy and valuable natural
            language applications.  Please note that
            computational linguistics is much broader than just voice assistants.  It is closely tied to search, big
            data, machine transcription, question answering services, natural language interfaces, machine translation,
            and about 1000 other applications that will reshape our communications in new ways.</p>
        <p>I love statistics and linguistics, and I want to break into the field because I believe that language is the
            key to understanding.  I believe that computing can foster understanding between cultures, and in education,
            in family history, and in general.  I hope to be a part of the revolution that brings more understanding to
            the world via computational linguistics.</p>
